## **Description üìÉ**
The objective of the game is to arrange the shuffled puzzle pieces in the correct order to complete the image.


## **Functionalities üéÆ**
- Start/Restart: Provide a button or option to start or restart the game, allowing the player to begin a new puzzle or replay the current one.

- Movement Validation: Implement checks to ensure that a puzzle piece can only be moved if there is an empty space adjacent to it. This prevents players from making invalid moves.

## **How to play? üïπÔ∏è**
- Game Board:
The game board consists of a grid that holds the puzzle pieces.
Each puzzle piece is represented by a square and contains a portion of the complete image.
One grid space will be left empty to allow for piece movement.

- Movement:
To move a puzzle piece, click and hold the mouse button on the piece you want to move.
While holding the mouse button, drag the piece to an adjacent empty space on the board.
Release the mouse button to drop the piece into the new position.
Only pieces that are adjacent to the empty space can be moved.

- Shuffle:
To start the game or shuffle the puzzle pieces during the game, click the "Shuffle" button.
The puzzle pieces will be randomly rearranged, creating a new challenge.

- Solve:
The objective is to arrange the puzzle pieces to match the original image.
Keep moving the pieces around the board until they are in the correct order.
The correct order is achieved when the numbers on the pieces are in ascending order from left to right and top to bottom.
